# Grading

There is no final written exam in the course. 
Your final grade for this course will consist of three components:

* A semester project, done in teams (40%). There are several deliveries throughout the semester.
* Readiness assurance tests (30%). These are several multiple-choice tests that cover the reading material. The RATs are carried out throughout the semester.
* Individual deliveries (30%). There are several deliveries throughout the semester.

The final grade in the course is based on a portfolio, with the intention to facilitate learning and to provide feedback to students throughout the semester, and enable learning in the context of realistic development conditions through a semester project. The portfolio contains a series of tests, so-called readiness assurance tests (RATs) that are done during class time. Each test introduces the students to a new subset of concepts, as a means to provide feedback on their level of preparation. These tests are multiple-choice and are given, like the preparation material, in English language only. 

To also develop skills and knowledge on higher cognitive levels, the portfolio contains a development project, tightly connected to the content of the RATs, that students conduct throughout the semester in teams. The teams hand in various specification documents about their system common in real projects, and receive feedback on them throughout the semester in various ways, including feedback by peers, student and teaching assistants and the teacher. 

At the end of the semester, each student hands in their individual portfolio, consisting of their team's documents in addition to individual deliveries and reflections that set the team document in context. 
The exact details of the deliveries and requirements are carefully explained at the beginning of the course.
The portfolio is evaluated as a whole according to NTNUs grading scheme. The language for all material is English.


# RATs

Each RAT is a combination of the individual RAT and the team RAT. The individual counts 70% and the team counts 30%. At the end of the semester, we only count the best 7 out of 9 RATs. 


# Team Deliveries T1, T2, T3

The team deliveries document your progress with the system. T1 and T2 are not directly graded, but they will be included, in improved form, in your final portfolio.



# Individual Deliveries I1, I2, I3

These are three consecutive deliveries that build on each other, and encourage you to reflect about the course, your own role and progress, and how you reached the learning goals. I2 and I2 are not directly graded, but make it easier for you to write the final portfolio.
