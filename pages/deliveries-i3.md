# I3: Final Individual Delivery



In the individual delivery, you need to deliver further evidence that you have reached the learning goals of the course and think independently about the course topics. 
The subject of your reflection can be anything relevant to the course and its learning goals. 
This means systems and system architectures, their description, the development process and the process during teamwork.

This part is highly individual. It depends on your personal observations and reflections, and it should be unique. 
You need to provide a maximum of 3 written pages in which you reflect about selected issues that relate to the learning goals of the course. 
You can decide what to write about, and you decide if you want to address a single point or several ones. 
We recommend not to try to address more than 3 topics, because you should provide a certain depth to each of them and provide consistent arguments.


# How to Make an Argument

No matter what you choose to write about, you need to make good arguments.
Good arguments are based on logically consistent reasoning, are based on facts and observations, are explained well and have an explicit conclusion. 

* You need to collect evidence for your argument. Explain situations that happened during the semester, point to diagrams or code, or point to the learning material.
* Construct a claim, and explain it. Make sure the reader understands your point.
* Discuss your claim. Consider counter-arguments, or tradeoffs, evidence against your argument. 
* Draw a conclusion, repeat or reinforce your main point.


### Language 

Of course, expressing yourself well will always be a benefit, and we encourage you to acquire excellent language skills. Also, check your delivery for typos and grammar. We will, however, ignore language issues as long as we understand what you mean.


# Examples for Topics

You should select the topic or topics to write about for yourself. You may also try to work on several topics, and then select the ones where you were most successful with the argumentation. There is no requirement that you cover *all* aspects, learning goals, or topics addressed in the course. 

Ideally, chose a topic that you care about, or where you gained the most insights, as this will probably improve your argumentation. For this reason, it's probably not a good idea that we show you a list with possible topics, as this may limit your creativity and maybe keep you from writing about a more unique topic. 
But we know that you will ask, so here is a list of examples and ideas anyway:

- About the system design and architecture choices.
- Quality of the state machine, correspondence between state machine and sequence diagram, or correspondence between state machine and implementation.
- An overall look on the correspondence of the requirements, possibly improved ones, with the realized system.
- Observations and insights into the development process.
- The quality of your delivery, maybe a critique of it.
- Your learning process, in relation to specific course concepts.
- ...any item of your choice, as long as they are connected to the learning goals of the course.



# Grading

The individual delivery is part of your portfolio, and it will weigh around 30 % for the final grade. For the performance level, we will apply [NTNU's general grading criteria](learning-grading.html#overall-generic-criteria). Notice the significance of *independent thinking* in the performance levels.


# Final Hints

- Be individual and unique. We not only recommend to work on your own, but also to not discuss your delivery with others.
- **The maximum length is 3 pages.** You can add an appendix that consists of screenshots of material that you can annotate. For instance, you can include a screenshot of a diagram and point out an issue that you refer to in your report.
- Deliveries I1 and I2 can help you towards I3. Apart from providing feedback to the other teams, they should also have started a reflection process on your own work and learning process. You can therefore take up points you made in I1 and I2 and develop them. 
- You can take **all teaching material**, including all presentations, articles and the guest lectures as input. You can, of course, also gather information outside of the provided learning material if you see need and fit.
- Revisit the learning goals of the course. They can be a valuable guide.
- Of course, all material must be written by yourself. Copying from others or letting others copy from you is not allowed. All reflections must be based on your experiences in the course. 
- Delivery I3 is not meant as a feedback on the course. For this, please use any of the other channels for course feedback. The focus is your own learning, and reflection about it. Of course, if you develop a point that naturally includes some feedback about the course you may do so.
- The recommended language for I3 is **English**. You can, however, also deliver in Norwegian, if you prefer.
