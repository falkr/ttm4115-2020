# The Headphone Story

This is an additional task if we have time left. 


You work as a summer intern at a computer company during the spring of 2007. You get the task to develop a controller for a mysterious remote control for some headphone stuff or so. Everyone is busy. A product manager drops by, and tells you:

    “The controller should translate button clicks into specific commands, depending on how often the user clicks. A single click should generate signal ’switch’. I think they use that for switching between playing and pausing. A double click should send signal ’next’. And if the user clicks three times in a row they need signal ’back’. That’s all I know. I have to go. Oh... the guys from the X-department gave me a diagram how it should be integrated. Here.”

You are confused, but you manage to produce a decent state machine.

Create the state machine. You probably need some individual focus time to try it out on a piece of paper before you sketch a solution in Draw.io.
